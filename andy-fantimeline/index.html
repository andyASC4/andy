        <p>Ash Ketchum is a 10 year old boy who never ages. His birthday is May 22nd, but that doesn't matter since he remains 10 even after about 13 years of travel. His goal is to become a Pokemon Master despite having lost every single league he has ever battled in. He also wants to catch every single Pokemon even though realistically that will never happen.</p>

        <h3 class="Header">Pikachu:</h3>
        <p>Ash has made many friends throughout his time traveling, but has ditched everyone in the long run because of his enjoyment traveling across the world. However, one partner he always keeps with him is his strongest Pokemon: Pikachu. Pikachu was Ash's first ever Pokemon, and has remained with him throughout all his travels. Pikachu's strength is undefined because it is able to defeat the strongest Pokemon such as Legendaries level 100 at the same time lose to starter Pokemon level 5.</p>

        <h4 class="Header">"The Very Best":</h4>
        <p>In order to achieve his unachievable dream, Ash must battle many strong trainers known as "Gym Leaders". Ash has won many badges during his travels. Whether it would be through smart methods like using his surroundings to his advantage or dumb methods like using thunderbolt on his own Flying-Type Pokemon as "Armor", Ash always finds a way to win. However, even after all his hard work to earn the badges, he ends up losing in the league and starting from square one again.</p>

        <p>During his travels, Ash catches many Pokemon. Although most of them are in storage with Professor Oak, they are all well trained and friendly towards him. Ash usually catches at least 6 Pokemon for each region he travels to.
